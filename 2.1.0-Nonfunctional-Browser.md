**IF YOU HAVE A NEW 3DS AND SOMEHOW GET YOURSELF TO 2.1 WITH NO NAND BACKUPS OR A BROKEN BROWSER, DO NOT UPDATE. IF YOU UPDATE FROM A 2.1 NEW 3DS TO A VERSION ABOVE 6.X, YOU WILL BRICK.**

If you downgraded to 2.1.0, **on Old 3DS, 2DS, or New 3DS** but for some reason you have a **nonfunctional browser**, this guide is for you.

If you downgraded to 2.1.0 **on Old 3DS, 2DS, or New 3DS** but for some reason have **no functional NAND backups** (*with* a functional browser), read [this](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/2.1.0-Stuck).

If you downgraded to 2.1.0 on **New 3DS** or **2DS** and **left Wireless Communication off** (with or without a functional browser), you can reset the wireless to be on by removing the battery for several seconds then booting back up.
