Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a SysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you are on versions 9.0.0 through 10.7.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Get-Started).

If you already have a RedNAND setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND.

Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

This section of the guide is just a part of the larger [9.2.0 Update](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/9.2.0-Update) section.

#### What you need

* A game cart that [contains the version](http://www.3dsdb.com/) specified in the chart

#### Instructions

1. Boot your 3DS into recovery mode by holding L+R+A+UP while powering on
2. Decline the update and reboot
1. Put the game in the system
2. Attempt to launch the game
3. Update when prompted

This will **not** update the browser in your system or install a browser if you have none. This will **only** update the actual system version *(for example, 2.1.0-0 -> 6.0.0-0)*. The last number *(the -0)* will **not** change.

If you are still below 9.0.0, you can now update to 9.2.0 with one of the methods in the appropriate section of the 9.2.0 Update chart [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/9.2.0-Update)

If you are now above 9.0.0, you can proceed to [Part 1 (Homebrew)](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Part-1-(Homebrew)).
