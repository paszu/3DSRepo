Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a SysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you are on versions 9.0.0 through 10.7.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Get-Started).

Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

This section of the guide is just a part of the larger [9.2.0 Update](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/9.2.0-Update) section.
