+ <a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest firmware version, is my device hackable?*    
  **A:** Yes, but only by [downgrading its firmware](Firmware-Downgrade/) (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4iry4s/)).

+ <a name="faq_n3ds" />**Q:** *Do I have to do anything different for New 3DS vs and Old 3DS or 2DS?*    
  **A:** All device models are done in the same way with the software used autodetecting which device you have

+ <a name="faq_updatecfw" />**Q:** *How do I update Luma3DS?*    
  **A:** Use Luma3DS Updater

+ <a name="faq_rednand" />**Q:** *What is the difference between RedNAND and EmuNAND?*    
  **A:** RedNAND and EmuNAND are both different types of [NAND redirection](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection) with small differences in the way they are handled behind the scenes. The main advantage to using RedNAND instead of EmuNAND is that RedNAND will *always* use the smallest [NAND size](NAND-Size) the device offers, regardless of the size of the SysNAND chip. For example, a New 3DS user with a 1.8GB internal NAND chip will only have to use 1.2GB for all RedNAND backups.

+ <a name="faq_gatewaysky" />**Q:** *I heard about this thing I have to pay for (Gateway, Sky3DS, etc), is that something I need?*    
  **A:** No. arm9loaderhax is a superior method of loading hax that runs early in boot and opens up the opportunity for things such as true custom firmware.

+ <a name="faq_gatewaysaves" />**Q:** *How do I move saves from an existing Gateway setup to device installed games?*    
  **A:** See [this](https://gbatemp.net/threads/425743/)

+ <a name="faq_need" />**Q:** *What do I need to do this guide?*    
  **A:** This guide can be completely done with free software and **(if you have no browser)** a compatible game   

+ <a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*    
  **A:** Bricks are now *basically* impossible unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks.

+ <a name="faq_piracy" />**Q:** *Can I pirate games with this?*    
  **A:** [Yes](https://github.com/Cruel/freeShop/releases). Do not ask me any further questions related to piracy than are answered here, there are plenty of other resources for that.

+ <a name="faq_piracy_online" />**Q:** *Can I play online with pirated games without getting banned?*    
  **A:** If you installed the CIA file, you won't get banned. If you are using a flashcart, you might be.

+ <a name="faq_piracy_header" />**Q:** *Do I need this thing I heard about called a private header?*    
  **A:** Those are only needed for flashcarts, not CIA installed games.

+ <a name="faq_homebrew" />**Q:** *Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?*    
  **A:** Yes! Custom Firmware not only enables the Homebrew Launcher, but it also will give you hacks on all versions, which means you keep it forever, even with updates.

+ <a name="faq_regionfree" />**Q:** *Can I use this to play games from other regions?*    
  **A:** Luma3DS supports Region Free patches, which enables users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps.

+ <a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update CFW SysNAND?*    
  **A:** Yes, but if you are feeling apprehensive you can wait until there is confirmation it works.

+ <a name="faq_support" />**Q:** *Where should I go for support?*    
  **A:** For support, ask for help at [#3dshacks on Rizon IRC](https://gate.omicron.pw).  

+ <a name="faq_le4gbsd" />**Q:** *Can I do this with a 4GB (or smaller) SD card?*    
  **A:** Thanks to the new CTRNAND method, yes!

+ <a name="faq_ge128gbsd" />**Q:** *Can I use a 128 GB (or larger) SD card?*    
  **A:** Yes, but some users have reported slowdowns when using such large sizes. Note that you cannot format the card with exFAT; you need to format it with FAT32.

+ <a name="faq_movesd" />**Q:** *How do I move to a new SD card at the end of this?*    
  **A:** Just copy all the files to the new SD card.

+ <a name="faq_NNID" />**Q:** *Can I keep my NNID?*    
  **A:** If you start with an NNID and follow every step, you will end up keeping your NNID at the end.

+ <a name="faq_systransfer" />**Q:** *What about System Transfers?*    
  **A:** Once you have completed the guide, you can system transfer to and from an arm9loaderhax'd 3DS or 2DS exactly like you would a regular stock console or EmuNAND (you will lose any non-legitimate games/themes/DLC in the transfer; saves will stay even for games that are lost).

+ <a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*    
  **A:** This guide, as of now, requires a computer to inject FBI into Health & Safety.

+ <a name="faq_problem" />**Q:** *Help! Something bad happened and now I cannot boot...*    
  **A:** Please look at the [[troubleshooting guide|Troubleshooting]].
