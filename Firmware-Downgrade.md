If you are on 11.0.0, you must follow this guide to downgrade your firmware using one of the methods at the bottom of this page to directly dump and restore your NAND.

If you are below version 9.0.0 then you should follow [this](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/9.2.0-Update) guide instead to update.    

If you are between 9.0.0 and 10.7.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Get-Started).    

Both of these are working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).

This will work on both a New and Old 3DS (although the DSiWare method has some restrictions).

**After following these instructions on version 11.0.0, you must have an alternate entrypoint such as one of the ones detailed in [Get Started](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Get-Started) in order to enter the homebrew launcher and downgrade.**

Use [this](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Hardmod-Downgrade/) link to downgrade your Firmware with a [hardmod](https://gbatemp.net/threads/414498/)    
Use [this](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/DSiWare-Downgrade/) link to downgrade your Firmware with DSiWare and a second 3DS (which already has CFW)
