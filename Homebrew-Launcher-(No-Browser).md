The Homebrew Launcher has many different entrypoints, or methods of launching. The most common is browserhax, which launches the Homebrew Launcher using nothing more than the included browser. This can then be used to install menuhax, which lets you hold a button while the console is booting up to launch the Homebrew Launcher before the rest of the system starts.

**11.0.0: You MUST have [downgraded your firmware](Firmware-Downgrade) already.**

#### What you need

+ The Homebrew [Starter Kit](http://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip)
+ One of the games listed in Step 2

#### Instructions

1. Copy the contents of the `starter` folder in `starter.zip` to the root of your SD card, then put the SD card back into your 3DS
2. Use one of the following alternate entrypoints to get into the homebrew launcher:
    + [smashbroshax](https://gbatemp.net/threads/397194/) *(requires Super Smash Bros __(if it is a cart, it must have "Nintendo Network" instead of "amiibo" on the cover, otherwise it is a reprint with an updated game version)__ and __only works on New 3DS__)*
    + [supermysterychunkhax](https://smd.salthax.org/) *(requires Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon and another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*
    + [freakyhax](http://plutooo.github.io/freakyhax/) *(requires Freakyforms Deluxe)*
    + [basehaxx](http://mrnbayoh.github.io/basehaxx/) *(requires Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire ver 1.0/1.4 with the ability to have a secret base and another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*
    + [BASICSploit](https://mrnbayoh.github.io/basicsploit/) *(requires SmileBASIC USA v3.2.1)*
    + [smilehax](https://plutooo.github.io/smilehax/) *(requires SmileBASIC USA or JPN v3.3.1)*
    + [stickerhax](https://github.com/yellows8/stickerhax) *(requires Paper Mario: Sticker Star and another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*    
    + [Ninjhax](http://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/) *(requires Cubic Ninja)*
    + [oot3dhax](https://github.com/yellows8/oot3dhax) *(requires Ocarina of Time 3D and either a powersaves or another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*    
10. Open the menuhax_manager application
11. Press (A) to install, it may show some errors but that's fine as long as it shows "Success" towards the end
12. Go back to the main menuhax_manager menu, then select "Configure menuhax"
13. Press (A) to continue, then select "Type1"
14. Hold (Down) on the D-Pad, then tap the touch screen; this is the recommended button to use for launching menuhax in this guide because it does not interfere with any other functions of tools we will be using
15. Go back to the main menuhax_manager menu, then press (Start) to exit back into the Homebrew Launcher
16. Press the (Start) button then press (A) to reboot

You can now hold D-Pad (Down) while the system is booting to launch the Homebrew Launcher

You can now continue from [9.2.0 Downgrade](9.2.0-Downgrade) *(even if you are already on a version from 9.0.0 to 9.2.0)*.
