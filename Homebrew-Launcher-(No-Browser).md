The Homebrew Launcher has many different entrypoints, or methods of launching. The most common is browserhax, which launches the Homebrew Launcher using nothing more than the included browser. This can then be used to install menuhax, which lets you hold a button while the console is booting up to launch the Homebrew Launcher before the rest of the system starts.

**11.0.0: You MUST have [downgraded your firmware](Firmware-Downgrade) already.**

#### What you need

+ The Homebrew [Starter Kit](http://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip)
+ One of the games listed in Step 2

#### Instructions

1. Copy the contents of `starter.zip` to the root of your SD card, then put the SD card back into your 3DS
2. Use one of the following alternate entrypoints to get into the homebrew launcher:
    + [smashbroshax](https://gbatemp.net/threads/397194/) *(requires Super Smash Bros. and __only works on New 3DS__)*
    + [supermysterychunkhax](https://smd.salthax.org/) *(requires Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon and another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*
    + [freakyhax](http://plutooo.github.io/freakyhax/) *(requires Freakyforms Deluxe)*
    + [basehaxx](http://mrnbayoh.github.io/basehaxx/) *(requires Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire ver 1.0/1.4 with the ability to have a secret base and another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*
    + [BASICSploit](https://mrnbayoh.github.io/basicsploit/) *(requires SmileBASIC)*
    + [smilehax](https://plutooo.github.io/smilehax/) *(requires SmileBASIC)*
    + [stickerhax](https://github.com/yellows8/stickerhax) *(requires Paper Mario: Sticker Star and another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*    
    + If the last number of your version is above -0 and you have *not* [cart updated](Cart-Update) with a game cart containing the version 9.9.0, then you have a browser installed. If you do still have a browser installed on the system (even if you can't use it without updating), you can still use some additional entrypoints that rely on it such as the following:
        + [Ninjhax](http://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/) *(requires Cubic Ninja)*
        + [oot3dhax](https://github.com/yellows8/oot3dhax) *(requires Ocarina of Time 3D and either a powersaves or another 3DS which has the Homebrew Launcher)*    
10. Open the menuhax_manager application
11. Press (A) to install, it may show some errors but that's fine as long as it shows "Success" towards the end
12. Go back to the main menuhax_manager menu, then select "Configure menuhax"
13. Press (A) to continue, then select "Type1"
14. Hold (Down) on the D-Pad, then tap the touch screen; this is the recommended button to use for launching menuhax in this guide because it does not interfere with any other functions of tools we will be using
15. Go back to the main menuhax_manager menu, then press (Start) to exit back into the Homebrew Launcher
16. Press the (Start) button then press (A) to reboot

You can now hold D-Pad (Down) while the system is booting to launch the Homebrew Launcher

You can now continue from [9.2.0 Downgrade](9.2.0-Downgrade) *(even if you are already on a version from 9.0.0 to 9.2.0)*.
